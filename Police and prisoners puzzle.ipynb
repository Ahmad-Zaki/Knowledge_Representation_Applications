    " - This Puzzle is known by many names: The gaurds and prisoners problem, the missionaries and cannibals problem, or jealous husbands problem. it's a classic river-crossing logic puzzle and a well-known toy problem in artificial intelligence, where it was used by Saul Amarel as an example of problem representation.\n",
    " - In the gaurds and prisoners problem, three gaurds and three prisoners must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are gaurds present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by prisoners (if they were, the prisoners would tackle the gaurds and escape). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board. And, in some variations, one of the prisoners has only one arm and cannot row, but that is not the case here.\n",
    " - We'll define a puzzle state by the number of gaurds and prisoners on each side + the location of the boat. The left side is dented by \"False\", and the right side is denoted by \"True\".\n",
    " - Each state we reach, we'll store it in a memory variable to avoid backward progress, where infinite loops may occur.\n",
    " - at each state, we'll try all possible moves until we find a state that doesn't violate the rules and isn't located at the memory\n",
    " - the puzzle is simple; there are no moves that would lead to a dead end."
